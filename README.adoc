= helm-charts

== Usage

Helm must be installed and setup to your kubernetes cluster to use the charts.
Refer to Helm's https://helm.sh/docs[documentation] to get started.
Once Helm has been set up correctly, fetch the charts as follows:

[source,bash]
----
helm pull oci://codeberg.org/wrenix/helm-charts/<chart>
----

You can install a chart release using the following command:

[source,bash]
----
helm install <release> oci://codeberg.org/wrenix/helm-charts/<chart> --values values.yaml
----

To uninstall a chart release use `helm`'s delete command:

[source,bash]
----
helm uninstall <release>
----
